I am a researcher in the field of astroparticle physics.

Experiments in this field are often quite large projects, run by hundreds of scientists, and producing "Big Data".
I am an expert in analysing these data.

I became first interested in astroparticle physics during my studies at RWTH Aachen University.
In my Bachelor and Master thesis projects, I have worked on radio detection of cosmic-ray air showers at the <a href="https://www.auger.org" target="_blank">Pierre Auger Observatory</a>, located in Argentina.

For my PhD I went to DESY, Zeuthen, joining the IceCube Collaboration -- a large international group of scientists operating the <a href="https://icecube.wisc.edu" target="_blank">IceCube Neutrino Observatory</a> at the geographical South Pole.
In my PhD project, I carried out the first comprehensive measurement of the energy spectrum and flavour composition of the cosmic neutrino flux that has been discovered with IceCube (see [here]({% link _research_projects/phd.md %}) for more details about my PhD work).

At my first PostDoc position at the Erlangen Centre for Astroparticle Physics, I then turned to gamma-ray astronomy and have worked with the [High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.)]({% link _research_experiments/hess.md %}), an array of five so-called "Cherenkov telescopes" located in Namibia.
With H.E.S.S., I study the sources of the highest-energy gamma rays in our Galaxy, the Milky Way.
I also contributed to the development of a successor experiment to H.E.S.S., the [Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA)]({% link _research_experiments/cta.md %}), which is going to be constructed during the next years in Chile and on the island of La Palma.

Recently, I have moved to Heidelberg and am currently working at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics (MPIK), where I am still involved with the H.E.S.S. and CTA projects.

When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with my family, reading a good book, and photography.
